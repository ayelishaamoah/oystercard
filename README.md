# Oystercard Challenge

Week 2: Pair programming challenge at Makers Academy. This challenge will help reinforce the topics learned in week one but introduce new topics through building a more complex program.

Topics will include; Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

**Focus goals**

This weeks challenge will be focusing on the following goals:

*I write code that is easy to change*
Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.
*I can test-drive my code*
Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.
*I can build with objects*
Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.
